My project is a travel app designed to motivate users to create bucket lists and check off their bucket items. A user can find items to add by keyword search, a D3 map to search by country, or by looking at popular bucket items. Facebook is integrated to make it easier for a user to connect with friends. Charts are used to display which Facebook friend has the most items in common and which countries they have the most uncompleted items in. A user can also visualize each list's locations via Google Maps. Lastly, when a user marks an item as complete, a progress wave gauge updates to show the percentage of completed items.
